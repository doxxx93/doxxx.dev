# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! This is my first blog post using Docusaurus. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What I've Learned So Far

Docusaurus is a modern static website generator. Here are a few things I've learned:

1. It's built with React
2. It uses Markdown for content
3. It's highly customizable

## What's Next

I plan to write more about my journey with Docusaurus and web development in general. Stay tuned!
